## How to Use

Configure Toit development environment and learn Toit language following comprehensive  guides in [Toit Documentation](https://docs.toit.io/)

[Start off](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted) by developing your applications using VS Code and Toit [console](https://docs.toit.io/platform/console) which is a dashboard for the Toit cloud, which offers various tools to upgrade your devices, monitor your device fleet health, view your daily data usage, and much more.

To accelerate your development use an off-cloud tool called [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) that enables live reloading when developing for the ESP32. Develop, update, and restart your code in less than two seconds on your local network via Wi-Fi. Use the really fast development cycle to iterate quickly and learn fast!
